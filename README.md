# Spring Boot GraphQL with Kotlin

## Project Objective
This repository is designed to help you **learn and develop APIs using Spring Boot with GraphQL in Kotlin**.  
It provides a hands-on approach to building robust, modern APIs with practical examples, including CRUD operations, queries, and mutations.

## Description
GraphQL is a powerful alternative to REST for API development, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need.  
This project demonstrates how to integrate **Spring Boot** with **GraphQL** using **Kotlin**, enabling you to:

- Create and manage entities with CRUD operations.
- Define queries and mutations for flexible data retrieval and manipulation.
- Handle relationships between entities efficiently.
- Implement file uploads and other advanced GraphQL features.
- Explore reactive programming with Kotlin and Spring Boot (optional).

The repository is suitable for beginners who want to get started with GraphQL as well as experienced developers looking to explore **Kotlin-based API development** with Spring Boot.

## Tech Stack
- **Kotlin** – Primary programming language
- **Spring Boot** – Backend framework
- **GraphQL** – API query language
- **MySQL** – Reactive database support
- **Gradle** – Build tool

## Learning Outcomes
By working with this project, you will learn how to:
1. Set up a Spring Boot project with GraphQL and Kotlin.
2. Design GraphQL schemas, queries, and mutations.
3. Perform CRUD operations using repositories.
4. Handle file uploads and updates (e.g., profile pictures).
5. Combine reactive programming patterns with GraphQL APIs.
